    <description>Allows us to group guests with the member that brought them. For members, this will just be their Attendee_Code__c + &#39;-A&#39; (the &quot;A&quot; is just to ensure the main member is above his/her guests), and for guests/non-members we use their host&#39;s attendee number plus a &quot;G&quot; at the end to help with sorting so they appear below their host.
